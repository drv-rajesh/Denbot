# Denbot
Denbot is an all-purpose Discord bot I created for my server, Dhruv's Den (not currently available to the public). It has functions such as invoking IOT data from various APIs, leisure activities such as fetching a random colour, and basic commands such as echoing back.

## Usage
There are multiple environment variables this project uses:
  - TOKEN (The key to control the bot) 
  - WEAKEY (The key for the OWM API): [Sign up here](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up)
  - NEWSKEY (The key for the News API): [Sign up here](https://newsapi.org/register)
  
Create a file called ".env", get the tokens for these APIs using the links above (and get the token for the bot), and then you should be able to implement it.
