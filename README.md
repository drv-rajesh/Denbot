# Denbot
Denbot is an all-purpose Discord bot I created for my server, Dhruv's Den (not currently available to the public). It has over 30 different functions in categories such as Leisure, General, Tools and Uts, and more.

## The Creation Process
This bot uses Flask and Python to host the server for free in the cloud and UptimeRobot to monitor the server. It also uses a variety of [APIs](/rmassets/apis.md) to fetch weather data, news data, and more.
